Features:
1) Door will be set with an initial pin. This pin will be given unencrypted in the box / with the product
2) Input code into phone application to gain authorization.
3) Give out temporary passwords for a given time interval. 

Pin will be stored in Arduino's 1 kilobyte permanent memory. When a signal is received, run an encryptPIN function on hard drive PIN and current system time.

User can specify a time window in which to grant another user a key. This will be represented to the user as a calendar / time selection box and internally as start/end offsets from the epoch.

Functions:

createRandomPIN(authorization_level):
    

encryptPIN(PIN, current_time):
    returns an encrypted PIN

addKey(PIN, start_time, end_time, current_time): 
    foreach temporary PIN on disk:
        if out of date, delete
        if there's no space for any more keys
            return Error
        Write PIN, along with start and end time

isMatch(PIN, key, current_time):
    if encryptPIN(PIN, current_time) == key:
        return true
    return false

getAccessLevel(PIN):
    gets an access level for PIN
    maybe some function of PIN % 10 or something

authenticate(key):
    get the master PIN.
    if isMatch:
        return full access
    foreach temporary PIN on disk:
        if out of date, skip
        if isMatch:
            return getAccessLevel(PIN)
    return no access
