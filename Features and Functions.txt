Features:
1) Door will be set with an initial pin. This pin will be given unencrypted in the box / with the product
2) Input code into phone application to gain authorization.
3) Give out temporary passwords for a given time interval. 

Pin will be stored in Arduino's 1 kilobyte permanent memory. When a signal is received, run an encryptPIN function on hard drive PIN and current system time. 
Default preference will be a block of time, starting and ending time (Military Time). Can be changed to a countdown.

Functions:


encryptPIN(unencrypted_PIN, time):
    returns an encrypted PIN

addKey(unencrypted_PIN, start_time, end_time, time): 
    for ever temporary key on disk:
        if out of date, delete
        if there's no space for any more keys
            return Error
        Write new key, along with start and end time

isMatch(unencrypted_PIN, received_PIN, time):
    if encryptPIN(unencrypted_PIN, time) == received_PIN:
        return true
    return false

getAccessLevel(temp_key):
    gets an access level for temp_key
    maybe some function of temp_key % 10 or something

authenticate(encryptedPIN):
    get the master PIN.
    if isMatch:
        return full access
    foreach temporary key on disk:
        if out of date, skip
        if isMatch:
            return getAccessLevel(key)
    return no access
